# Specification Quality Checklist: Filesystem Template Storage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**All Clarifications Resolved**:

1. **User Story 2, Acceptance Scenario 3**: Folder deletion behavior
   - **Resolution**: Prevent folder deletion if it contains templates. System will display an error message requiring the folder to be empty before deletion.

2. **User Story 3, Acceptance Scenario 1**: Metadata storage format
   - **Resolution**: Store metadata as YAML frontmatter within the .md file itself, keeping all template data in a single human-readable file.

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items complete. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
