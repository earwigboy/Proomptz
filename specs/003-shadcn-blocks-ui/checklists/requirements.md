# Specification Quality Checklist: UI Enhancement with Shadcn Blocks and Blue Theme

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality - PASS

- The specification maintains technology-agnosticism by referring to "shadcn Sidebar block" and "blue theme" as the solution being implemented (which IS the feature, similar to the shadcn migration spec)
- User stories focus on value delivered: professional appearance, visual consistency, better UX
- Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes (navigation efficiency, visual consistency, accessibility)
- All mandatory sections are present and complete: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies & Constraints

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions are clear:
  - Using shadcn Sidebar block (specified in user input)
  - Blue theme (specified in user input)
  - Maintaining existing functionality (implicit requirement)
  - Dark mode as primary (based on current implementation)
- All 15 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria include both quantitative (page load <100ms increase, WCAG contrast ratios, mobile breakpoint <768px) and qualitative measures (professional feel, visual appeal)
- Success criteria are appropriately technology-agnostic where possible (e.g., "Visual consistency score improves" rather than "Tailwind classes are correct")
- 3 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (5 scenarios each)
- Edge cases cover technical concerns (collapsed sidebar interactions, CSS conflicts, small screens, browser extensions, theme transitions)
- Scope boundaries clearly separate in-scope UI work from out-of-scope feature additions
- 10 assumptions documented (shadcn installed, blocks compatibility, blue theme definition, dark mode primary)
- Dependencies and constraints documented (must not break functionality, maintain accessibility, bundle size limits)

### Feature Readiness - PASS

- Each of the 15 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable as required:
  - P1: Sidebar implementation - can be tested and delivers navigation improvements independently
  - P2: Blue theme application - can be tested after P1 and delivers visual consistency independently
  - P3: Layout enhancements - can be tested after P1/P2 and delivers polished UI independently
- Success criteria are measurable:
  - SC-001: Navigation efficiency (no functional regressions)
  - SC-002: Visual consistency (cohesive blue theme colors)
  - SC-003: Accessibility (WCAG AA contrast requirements)
  - SC-004: User satisfaction (qualitative improvement)
  - SC-005: Mobile responsiveness (<768px width)
  - SC-006: Performance (page load +100ms limit)
  - SC-007: Zero functional regressions
- No leaked implementation details - the spec appropriately describes WHAT needs improvement (UI/theme) and WHY (better aesthetics, professionalism), while leaving HOW to the planning phase

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All checklist items pass validation. The feature is well-scoped as a UI enhancement project with clear success criteria and independently testable user stories. No clarifications needed - all decisions were clearly specified in the user input or have reasonable defaults documented in assumptions.
