# Feature Specification: UI Enhancement with Shadcn Blocks and Blue Theme

**Feature Branch**: `003-shadcn-blocks-ui`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Use Shadcn blocks to improve the UI. I want to use the Sidebar block to contain the existing folders view. I also want to improve the overall theme, at the moment the colorscheme is not very pleasant. Use the Shadcn blue theme."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Professional Sidebar Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a user managing prompt templates, I need a clean, professional sidebar that contains the folder navigation, so that I can easily browse and organize my templates without the interface feeling cluttered or visually unappealing.

**Why this priority**: The sidebar is the primary navigation mechanism for the application. Replacing the current basic implementation with a shadcn Sidebar block provides immediate visual improvement and better UX patterns (collapsible, responsive, professional styling). This is the foundation for the entire UI refresh.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application and verifying the new sidebar displays the folder tree correctly, can be collapsed/expanded, works on mobile screens, and maintains all existing folder navigation functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the application, **When** I view the left panel, **Then** I see a professional shadcn Sidebar block containing the folder tree navigation
2. **Given** I am viewing the sidebar, **When** I click the collapse/expand toggle, **Then** the sidebar smoothly transitions between collapsed and expanded states
3. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I open the application, **Then** the sidebar adapts responsively (collapsible overlay or hidden by default)
4. **Given** I am viewing the sidebar, **When** I interact with folders (expand, select, create), **Then** all existing folder functionality works exactly as before
5. **Given** I have the sidebar expanded, **When** I view the folder tree, **Then** the visual hierarchy and spacing matches shadcn design patterns

### User Story 2 - Cohesive Blue Theme Application (Priority: P2)

As a user of the prompt template manager, I want the entire application to use a cohesive, pleasant blue color scheme, so that the interface feels polished, modern, and visually consistent rather than the current unpleasant color combination.

**Why this priority**: After establishing the sidebar structure (P1), applying a cohesive theme across the entire application ensures visual consistency. The blue theme provides better aesthetics and professionalism, improving user satisfaction and reducing visual fatigue.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through all application screens and verifying that buttons, cards, inputs, dialogs, and all UI elements use the blue theme consistently with proper contrast ratios and visual harmony.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open any page in the application, **When** I view UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs), **Then** they use the shadcn blue theme color palette
2. **Given** I am viewing the application, **When** I compare colors across different screens, **Then** all colors are cohesive and follow the blue theme design tokens
3. **Given** I interact with interactive elements (hover, focus, active states), **When** I observe state changes, **Then** color transitions use blue theme variants appropriately
4. **Given** I view text content, **When** I check contrast ratios, **Then** all text meets WCAG accessibility standards against blue theme backgrounds
5. **Given** I switch between light mode and dark mode (if applicable), **When** the theme changes, **Then** the blue color scheme adapts appropriately while maintaining visual consistency

### User Story 3 - Enhanced Layout with Shadcn Blocks (Priority: P3)

As a user creating and managing templates, I want other parts of the interface (header, main content area, forms) to use shadcn block patterns, so that the entire application feels like a modern, well-designed product with consistent spacing, typography, and component styling.

**Why this priority**: After sidebar (P1) and theme (P2) are established, enhancing other layout areas with shadcn blocks provides the finishing touches for a completely refreshed UI. This includes improved header, better content area layout, and potentially using shadcn block patterns for template cards and search interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating/editing templates, searching, and navigating the app to verify that all major UI sections use shadcn block patterns with consistent spacing, alignment, and visual treatment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I view the application header, **When** I observe the layout, **Then** it uses shadcn block patterns with consistent spacing and alignment
2. **Given** I am viewing the main content area, **When** I observe template cards and lists, **Then** they follow shadcn block layout patterns with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
3. **Given** I am using forms (create/edit template, folder dialogs), **When** I observe the layout, **Then** form sections use shadcn block patterns for consistent structure
4. **Given** I navigate between different views (list, search results, template usage), **When** I observe transitions, **Then** all views maintain consistent shadcn block-based layouts
5. **Given** I resize the browser window, **When** I observe responsive behavior, **Then** shadcn blocks adapt gracefully to different screen sizes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the sidebar is collapsed and a user tries to create a new folder from a context menu?
- How does the theme handle custom CSS that might conflict with blue theme variables?
- What happens on very small screens where the sidebar block might not have enough space?
- How does the application handle users who may have browser extensions that modify colors?
- What happens when migrating from the current theme to blue theme - are there any jarring visual transitions on first load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the current folder navigation panel with a shadcn Sidebar block component
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all existing folder navigation functionality (expand/collapse folders, select folder, create folder, rename folder, delete folder, drag-drop templates)
- **FR-003**: Sidebar MUST support collapse/expand toggle functionality
- **FR-004**: Sidebar MUST be responsive and adapt to mobile screen sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply the shadcn blue theme color palette to all UI components (buttons, cards, inputs, dialogs, badges, alerts)
- **FR-006**: System MUST update CSS variables and theme tokens to use blue theme values
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all text content maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios against blue theme backgrounds
- **FR-008**: System MUST update the application header to use shadcn block patterns
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain dark mode functionality while applying the blue theme
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure hover, focus, and active states use appropriate blue theme color variants
- **FR-011**: System MUST apply shadcn block layout patterns to the main content area
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure existing features (template creation, editing, search, usage) continue to work identically after UI changes
- **FR-013**: System MUST not introduce visual regressions or breaking changes to existing layouts
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain current accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- **FR-015**: Sidebar MUST display the folder count for each folder as before

### Key Entities

*No new data entities introduced - this is a UI-only enhancement to existing template and folder entities*

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can navigate the folder tree in the new sidebar with the same speed and efficiency as the current implementation (no functional regressions)
- **SC-002**: Visual consistency score improves - all UI elements use cohesive blue theme colors (verifiable through visual inspection and theme token usage)
- **SC-003**: Accessibility standards maintained - all new UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **SC-004**: User interface feels more professional and visually appealing compared to current implementation (qualitative improvement verified through user feedback)
- **SC-005**: Sidebar adapts to mobile screens (< 768px width) without breaking layout or losing functionality
- **SC-006**: Page load time does not increase by more than 100ms due to new UI components
- **SC-007**: All existing features continue to work without bugs after UI refresh (zero functional regressions in manual testing)

## Scope *(mandatory)*

### In Scope

- Implementing shadcn Sidebar block for folder navigation
- Applying shadcn blue theme color palette to all components
- Updating theme tokens, CSS variables, and color values
- Ensuring sidebar collapse/expand functionality
- Making sidebar responsive for mobile screens
- Applying shadcn block patterns to header and main content areas
- Maintaining all existing functionality during UI changes
- Ensuring accessibility standards are maintained
- Testing visual consistency across all screens

### Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality beyond UI improvements
- Redesigning the information architecture or navigation structure
- Adding new sidebar sections or navigation items
- Implementing a theme switcher to allow users to choose different colors
- Creating custom shadcn block variations beyond standard patterns
- Performance optimization beyond maintaining current performance
- Backend changes or API modifications
- Adding animations or transitions beyond what shadcn blocks provide by default

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

1. The shadcn/ui library is already installed and configured in the project (from previous migration - feature 002)
2. Shadcn blocks are available and compatible with the current React/TypeScript setup
3. The blue theme refers to shadcn's standard blue color palette
4. Dark mode is the primary theme, and blue colors should be adapted for dark backgrounds
5. Current folder tree component can be placed inside a shadcn Sidebar block without major refactoring
6. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling (already in place from previous shadcn migration)
7. No breaking changes to the component API are needed - only visual/layout changes
8. The current sidebar width and behavior are acceptable starting points for the new design
9. Browser compatibility requirements remain the same (modern browsers supporting current tech stack)
10. Users are comfortable with a sidebar that can collapse/expand (standard UI pattern)

## Dependencies & Constraints *(mandatory)*

### Dependencies

- Completion of feature 002 (shadcn/ui migration) - shadcn components must be installed
- Shadcn blocks library/documentation for Sidebar block implementation patterns
- Tailwind CSS configuration for blue theme token updates
- Current folder navigation component structure must be understood to integrate with Sidebar block

### Constraints

- Must not break existing folder navigation functionality
- Must maintain current accessibility standards (WCAG AA compliance)
- Must not significantly increase bundle size (keep within reasonable limits)
- Must work within current React 19 and TypeScript 5 setup
- Must maintain current performance characteristics
- Must preserve dark mode functionality
- Blue theme must be compatible with existing shadcn components already in use
- Changes must be reversible if issues arise (maintain git history)

## Risks *(optional)*

- **Risk**: Shadcn Sidebar block may not accommodate current folder tree structure without significant refactoring
  - **Mitigation**: Review shadcn Sidebar block documentation early; identify integration points; consider progressive enhancement approach

- **Risk**: Blue theme colors may not provide sufficient contrast in dark mode
  - **Mitigation**: Use shadcn's recommended blue theme tokens for dark mode; run WCAG contrast checks; adjust color values if needed

- **Risk**: Users may be resistant to UI changes and prefer current look
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure all functionality remains identical; document changes; consider user feedback mechanisms; maintain git history for rollback

- **Risk**: Mobile responsive behavior may require more work than anticipated
  - **Mitigation**: Test on various screen sizes early; use shadcn's responsive patterns; prioritize mobile-friendly sidebar behavior

- **Risk**: CSS conflicts between current custom styles and new blue theme
  - **Mitigation**: Audit existing custom CSS; remove redundant styles; ensure theme tokens are properly scoped; test thoroughly
