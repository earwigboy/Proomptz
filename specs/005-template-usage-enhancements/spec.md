# Feature Specification: Template Usage Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `005-template-usage-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Incremental improvements to Use Template. 1. The Preview and Edit Template Content text area needs to be bigger. Templates can potentially be very large. 2. When you edit a template, by clicking in the text and enter some text, the form fields for the placeholders expand and move the edit template component to the right. 3. When returning to the main screen from anywhere in the app it should remember which folder was previously selected."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Template Editing Experience (Priority: P1)

Users need to view and edit large template content comfortably without constant scrolling or layout disruption. When working with potentially lengthy templates, users should have adequate visual space to review and modify template text while simultaneously managing placeholder values.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the core usability issue that directly impacts the primary workflow of template usage. Users cannot effectively work with templates if the editing area is too small or the layout shifts unpredictably during editing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a template with significant content (500+ lines), editing placeholder values and template content, and verifying that the text area provides sufficient viewing space and the layout remains stable during editing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens a template with 500+ lines of content, **When** they view the template editor, **Then** the text area displays at least 30 visible lines without scrolling to see key content sections
2. **Given** a user is editing a template, **When** they type text into the template content area, **Then** the placeholder form fields remain in a fixed position and do not cause the editor to shift horizontally or vertically
3. **Given** a user is entering placeholder values, **When** the placeholder values expand to multiple lines or longer text, **Then** the template editor component maintains its position and dimensions

### User Story 2 - Persistent Folder Selection (Priority: P2)

Users expect the application to remember their last selected folder when navigating between screens. This allows users to maintain their working context as they move through different parts of the application workflow without having to repeatedly re-select the same folder.

**Why this priority**: This is an important quality-of-life improvement that reduces repetitive actions but does not block core template usage functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a specific folder on the main screen, navigating to another screen (e.g., template editor), returning to the main screen, and verifying that the previously selected folder is still active.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has selected "Marketing Templates" folder on the main screen, **When** they navigate to the template usage screen and then return to the main screen, **Then** the "Marketing Templates" folder remains selected
2. **Given** a user has selected a folder and closes the application, **When** they reopen the application and view the main screen, **Then** no folder is selected (folder selection resets to default state on application restart)
3. **Given** a user selects a folder and performs any navigation within the app, **When** they return to the main screen from any location, **Then** their folder selection is preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a template exceeds 10,000 lines? Does the text area maintain performance and usability?
- How does the system handle rapid typing in the template editor that might trigger multiple layout recalculations?
- What happens if a user selects a folder that has been deleted by another process before returning to the main screen?
- How does folder selection behave when multiple instances of the application are open simultaneously within the same session?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The template content text area MUST display a minimum height that shows at least 30 lines of content simultaneously without scrolling
- **FR-002**: The template editor layout MUST prevent horizontal or vertical shifting of the edit template component when placeholder form fields expand or contract
- **FR-003**: The placeholder form fields MUST use a fixed-width layout or scrollable container that does not affect the template editor component positioning
- **FR-004**: The application MUST persist the currently selected folder identifier in session memory when users navigate away from the main screen
- **FR-005**: The application MUST restore the previously selected folder when users return to the main screen from any other screen within the same session
- **FR-006**: If a previously selected folder no longer exists upon return, the system MUST default to the first available folder or a "no folder selected" state
- **FR-007**: The application MUST clear folder selection state when the application session ends (on close/restart)

### Key Entities

- **Folder Selection State**: Represents the currently active folder identifier that needs to be preserved across navigation events within a single application session (cleared on application close)
- **Template Content**: The potentially large text content that requires adequate display space for user review and editing
- **Placeholder Form Fields**: Dynamic form inputs whose size can change based on user input and should not affect surrounding layout

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view and edit templates containing up to 1,000 lines without requiring excessive scrolling (defined as scrolling more than 5 times to review full content)
- **SC-002**: Layout stability - The template editor component position does not shift by more than 5 pixels when placeholder values are edited
- **SC-003**: Folder selection is successfully restored in 100% of navigation scenarios during normal operation
- **SC-004**: Users complete template editing tasks 25% faster due to improved visibility and layout stability
