# Tasks: Template Usage Screen Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-template-usage-enhancements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Manual testing only (no test framework configured per constitution decision)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Frontend: `frontend/src/`
- No backend changes required (frontend-only feature)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create TypeScript type definitions and prepare component structure

- [x] T001 [P] Create TypeScript types for placeholders in frontend/src/lib/types/placeholders.ts
- [x] T002 [P] Create TypeScript types for template editor in frontend/src/lib/types/templateEditor.ts
- [x] T003 [P] Create TypeScript types for validation in frontend/src/lib/types/validation.ts
- [x] T004 [P] Create type exports barrel file in frontend/src/lib/types/index.ts
- [x] T005 Create template/ component directory in frontend/src/components/template/

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Type definitions ready - hook and component implementation can begin

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core hooks and utilities that MUST be complete before ANY user story UI can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until these hooks are complete

- [x] T006 Modify usePlaceholders hook to add validation state in frontend/src/lib/hooks/usePlaceholders.ts
- [x] T007 [P] Create useTemplateEditor hook in frontend/src/lib/hooks/useTemplateEditor.ts

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ All hooks ready - user story UI implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Enhanced Placeholder Input Experience (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Improve placeholder form fields with appropriate input types (text vs textarea), clear labels, and validation feedback

**Independent Test**: Open template with placeholders, verify improved form fields render with text inputs for short values and textareas for long values, fill placeholders and verify validation feedback appears for empty required fields

### Implementation for User Story 1

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Validation-Based Button Activation (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Disable "Send to Devin" button until all required placeholders are filled, with clear feedback explaining why button is disabled

**Independent Test**: Open template with unfilled placeholders, verify "Send to Devin" button is disabled, fill placeholders one by one and verify button only enables when all are filled, clear a placeholder and verify button disables again

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T016 [US2] Integrate useFormValidation hook in TemplateUsage page to compute canSubmit state in frontend/src/pages/TemplateUsage.tsx
- [x] T017 [US2] Update "Send to Devin" button to use canSubmit for disabled prop in frontend/src/pages/TemplateUsage.tsx
- [x] T018 [US2] Add Tooltip component wrapper around "Send to Devin" button in frontend/src/pages/TemplateUsage.tsx

- [x] T022 [US2] Update button visual state (disabled styling) from shadcn/ui Button component in frontend/src/pages/TemplateUsage.tsx

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ User Story 2 complete - "Send to Devin" button should be disabled until validation passes, with clear feedback via tooltip and screen reader announcement

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Template Content Editing Before Sending (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to edit the fully-resolved template content after filling placeholders, with ability to preview edits and reset to original

**Independent Test**: Fill placeholder values, switch to Edit tab, modify template content, verify changes are preserved in preview, click Reset button and verify content reverts to original resolved template

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T036 [US3] Update "Send to Devin" action to use getContentToSend() from useTemplateEditor hook in frontend/src/pages/TemplateUsage.tsx

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ User Story 3 complete - users should be able to switch between Preview and Edit tabs, modify template content, and reset to original

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Larger Preview for Better Template Visibility (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Increase preview box size to show significantly more template content at once, with responsive design for different screen sizes

**Independent Test**: Open template with long content (20+ lines), verify preview box displays at least 50% more visible lines than before (target 25-30+ lines on desktop), test on mobile/tablet/desktop viewports to ensure responsive sizing

### Implementation for User Story 4

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - Can proceed independently
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and User Story 1 (Phase 3) completion - Builds on US1 form
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - Can proceed independently (but integrates with US1/US2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 3 (Phase 5) completion - Modifies same components as US3
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Requires placeholder form to exist
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable but integrates with US1/US2 components
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Modifies PromptPreview component created/modified in US3

### Within Each User Story

- Type definitions before hooks (Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2)
- Hooks before components (Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3+)
- Components before page integration (component files ‚Üí TemplateUsage.tsx)
- Core implementation before edge case testing (implementation tasks ‚Üí polish tasks)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 5 tasks can run in parallel (different files)
- T001, T002, T003, T004, T005

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T007 and T008 can run in parallel (different files)
- T007 (useTemplateEditor.ts)
- T008 (useFormValidation.ts)
- Note: T006 modifies existing file, should complete first

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: T009 and T010 can start together (same file, sequential edits)

**User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Most tasks sequential (same file: TemplateUsage.tsx)

**User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Component creation can run in parallel
- T023, T024, T025, T026 (TemplateEditor.tsx - sequential edits to same file)
- T027-T036 (TemplateUsage.tsx - sequential edits to same file)
- TemplateEditor.tsx tasks can run in parallel with TemplateUsage.tsx tasks

**User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Component modification can run in parallel
- T037, T038, T039, T040 (PromptPreview.tsx)
- T041, T042, T043, T044, T045 (TemplateUsage.tsx)
- Different component files can be modified in parallel

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: Most edge case tests can run in parallel
- T046, T047, T048, T049, T050, T051 (different test scenarios)

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 (Setup)

All type definition files can be created simultaneously:

```bash
Task T001: "Create placeholders.ts types"
Task T002: "Create templateEditor.ts types"
Task T003: "Create validation.ts types"
Task T004: "Create index.ts barrel exports"
Task T005: "Create template/ directory"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Implementation)

Component creation can proceed in parallel with page integration:

```bash
# Team Member A - TemplateEditor component:
Task T023: "Create TemplateEditor component"
Task T024: "Add Reset button"
Task T025: "Add styling"
Task T026: "Add ARIA attributes"

# Team Member B - TemplateUsage page integration (can start in parallel):
Task T027: "Add Tabs component"
Task T028: "Add TabsList"
Task T029: "Add Preview TabsContent"
Task T030: "Add Edit TabsContent"
```
