# Feature Specification: Template Usage Screen Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `004-template-usage-enhancements`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "On the use template screen we need to update so that 1. entering the values for the placeholders uses better form fields. 2. It is possible to edit the template contents prior to sending to Devin. 3. The preview box is bigger, so that it can show templates more clearly. 4. Send to Devin button should be disabled until the placeholders have been set."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Placeholder Input Experience (Priority: P1)

As a user filling out a template with placeholders, I need improved form fields for entering placeholder values, so that I can provide input more efficiently and with better guidance on what's expected for each placeholder.

**Why this priority**: Placeholder input is the core interaction on the template usage screen. Without good form fields, users struggle to understand what input is needed and may make errors. This is the foundation for using templates effectively and must be the first priority.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a template with placeholders, observing the form fields presented, entering values, and verifying that the input experience is intuitive, properly validated, and clearly indicates what's expected for each placeholder.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open a template with multiple placeholders, **When** I view the placeholder input form, **Then** I see clearly labeled form fields for each placeholder with appropriate input types (text input for short values, textarea for longer values)
2. **Given** I am entering values for placeholders, **When** I interact with each form field, **Then** I see helpful labels, placeholders, and validation feedback that guide me toward correct input
3. **Given** I have filled in some placeholders but not all, **When** I review the form, **Then** I can clearly see which placeholders still need values and which are complete
4. **Given** I enter an invalid or empty value for a required placeholder, **When** I attempt to proceed, **Then** I receive clear validation feedback indicating what needs to be corrected
5. **Given** I have successfully filled all placeholder values, **When** I review my inputs, **Then** the form provides clear visual confirmation that all required inputs are complete

### User Story 2 - Validation-Based Button Activation (Priority: P1)

As a user on the template usage screen, I need the "Send to Devin" button to be disabled until all placeholders are filled, so that I cannot accidentally send an incomplete template and receive clear feedback on what's missing.

**Why this priority**: Sending templates with unfilled placeholders wastes time and creates confusion. This validation is critical for preventing errors and should be implemented alongside the enhanced form fields (P1). It's a foundational safeguard that ensures data integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a template with placeholders, observing that the "Send to Devin" button is disabled, filling in placeholders one by one, and verifying that the button only becomes enabled when all required placeholders have values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open a template with unfilled placeholders, **When** I view the usage screen, **Then** the "Send to Devin" button is disabled and shows a clear visual indication that it cannot be clicked
2. **Given** I have filled some but not all placeholders, **When** I check the "Send to Devin" button, **Then** it remains disabled and ideally shows feedback about which placeholders still need values
3. **Given** I have filled all required placeholders, **When** I check the "Send to Devin" button, **Then** it becomes enabled and ready to click
4. **Given** the "Send to Devin" button is disabled, **When** I hover over or attempt to click it, **Then** I receive clear feedback explaining why it's disabled (e.g., tooltip, message indicating unfilled placeholders)
5. **Given** I clear a previously filled placeholder value, **When** I check the "Send to Devin" button, **Then** it becomes disabled again until the placeholder is refilled

---

### User Story 3 - Template Content Editing Before Sending (Priority: P2)

As a user preparing to send a template to Devin, I need the ability to edit the template content after filling placeholders, so that I can make final adjustments, refinements, or corrections before sending the template.

**Why this priority**: After filling placeholders, users often need to make small tweaks, add context, or correct mistakes. Without editing capability, users must either accept imperfect output or go back and recreate the template. This significantly improves the final quality of templates sent to Devin.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by filling placeholder values in a template, accessing the template content editor, making changes to the content, and verifying that those changes are preserved and included when sending to Devin.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have filled in placeholder values for a template, **When** I access the template editor, **Then** I can see and edit the fully-resolved template content with all placeholder values substituted
2. **Given** I am editing the template content, **When** I make changes to the text, **Then** my changes are preserved and reflected in the preview
3. **Given** I have made edits to the template content, **When** I send the template to Devin, **Then** the sent content includes all my edits
4. **Given** I am viewing the template editor, **When** I modify the content, **Then** I can see a clear indication that the content has been modified from the original template
5. **Given** I want to discard my edits, **When** I choose to reset or revert, **Then** the template content returns to the original state with filled placeholders

---

### User Story 4 - Larger Preview for Better Template Visibility (Priority: P3)

As a user reviewing a template before sending it to Devin, I need a larger preview box, so that I can see more of the template content at once without excessive scrolling and better understand the full context of what I'm sending.

**Why this priority**: A small preview box forces users to scroll frequently and makes it difficult to review longer templates. While important for user experience, this is primarily a visual/UX improvement that doesn't block core functionality, making it lower priority than input improvements and editing capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening various templates (short and long) on the usage screen, observing the preview box size, and verifying that users can read and comprehend template content more easily with less scrolling compared to the current implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open a template on the usage screen, **When** I view the preview box, **Then** the preview area takes up significantly more screen real estate than before, allowing me to see more content at once
2. **Given** I have a long template with many lines, **When** I review it in the preview, **Then** I can see a substantial portion of the content without scrolling, making it easier to understand the full context
3. **Given** I am on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), **When** I view the preview box, **Then** the preview scales appropriately to maximize visibility while maintaining usability
4. **Given** I have filled placeholder values, **When** I view the preview, **Then** the larger preview box clearly shows the resolved template content with proper formatting and line breaks
5. **Given** I am editing the template content, **When** I toggle between edit and preview modes, **Then** both modes provide adequate space for reviewing and modifying the content

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a template has no placeholders? Should the "Send to Devin" button be immediately enabled?
- What happens if I fill all placeholders, edit the template content to remove or add placeholders? How does button validation handle dynamic content changes?
- What happens if I fill placeholders but then the template content is edited to be completely empty? Should the button be enabled or disabled?
- How does the system handle very long template content in the preview box? Is there a maximum height with scrolling, or does it expand indefinitely?
- What happens if I navigate away from the template usage screen with unsaved placeholder values or edits? Should there be a warning about losing changes?
- How does the preview box handle templates with special formatting, code blocks, or markdown? Does it preserve formatting or display raw text?

### Key Entities

- **Template**: Represents the prompt template being used, containing original content with placeholder markers
- **Placeholder**: A named field within a template that requires user input, with attributes like name, description, whether it's required, and input type
- **Placeholder Value**: The user-provided value for a specific placeholder
- **Resolved Template**: The template content with all placeholder values substituted
- **Edited Template**: The resolved template content that has been modified by the user before sending

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can identify and understand what input is needed for each placeholder without confusion (qualitatively measured through user testing or feedback)
- **SC-002**: Users successfully fill all placeholders on the first attempt at least 90% of the time (reducing errors and incomplete submissions)
- **SC-003**: Users can edit template content and see changes reflected in the preview within 1 second of making edits
- **SC-004**: The preview box displays at least 50% more visible lines of template content compared to the current implementation (on standard desktop viewport)
- **SC-005**: Users cannot accidentally send incomplete templates with unfilled placeholders (100% prevention through button validation)
- **SC-006**: Users receive immediate visual feedback when attempting to send with unfilled placeholders (button remains disabled, clear messaging provided)

- **SC-008**: Template editing feature is used by at least 30% of users who fill templates, indicating it provides value
- **SC-009**: The larger preview box reduces user-reported difficulty in reviewing longer templates by at least 40%

## Scope *(mandatory)*

### In Scope

- Redesigning the placeholder input form with improved field types (text inputs, textareas)
- Adding clear labels, descriptions, and validation feedback for placeholder fields
- Implementing real-time validation of placeholder completeness
- Adding a template content editor that allows users to modify resolved template text
- Providing a mechanism to reset edited content to original state
- Increasing the size of the template preview box to show more content
- Making the preview box responsive across device sizes
- Implementing button state management that disables "Send to Devin" when placeholders are incomplete
- Providing clear visual and textual feedback for why the button is disabled
- Enabling the button dynamically as placeholders are filled
- Maintaining existing functionality for sending templates to Devin

### Out of Scope

- Changing the underlying template data model or storage
- Adding new template creation or management features
- Implementing advanced text editor features (syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc.) for template editing
- Adding version control or history for template edits
- Implementing collaboration features (sharing, commenting on templates)
- Changing the integration with Devin (how templates are sent remains the same)
- Adding placeholder type validation beyond presence/absence (e.g., format validation for emails, URLs)
- Implementing auto-save for placeholder values or edits
- Adding AI-powered suggestions or assistance for filling placeholders or editing content

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

1. The current template usage screen already exists with basic functionality for filling placeholders and sending to Devin
2. Templates have a defined structure with identifiable placeholders (e.g., `{{placeholder_name}}` or similar)
3. The system can determine which placeholders are required vs. optional
4. Users access the template usage screen with sufficient screen space to accommodate a larger preview (primarily desktop/tablet, with mobile being a secondary consideration)
5. The "Send to Devin" action is a discrete event that can be triggered by a button click
6. Template content is primarily plain text or markdown (not rich HTML or complex formatting that would require a WYSIWYG editor)
7. The editing feature allows free-form text editing without complex constraints
8. Users understand that edited content replaces the original template + placeholders when sent to Devin
9. The system can track placeholder fill state in real-time to enable/disable the send button
10. Browser/client-side validation is acceptable for button state (doesn't require server-side validation before enabling button)

## Dependencies & Constraints *(mandatory)*

### Dependencies

- Existing template data structure and placeholder parsing logic
- Current integration with Devin (method of sending templates)
- Frontend framework and component library being used for the template usage screen
- State management solution for tracking placeholder values and edits

### Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing templates and their placeholder formats
- Changes must not break the existing workflow for users who are accustomed to the current interface
- Preview box size increase must not negatively impact usability on smaller screens (mobile, small tablets)
- Editing functionality must not introduce significant performance overhead when dealing with long templates
- Button validation must be responsive (no noticeable lag when typing in placeholder fields)
- Implementation should follow existing UI/UX patterns and design system used in the application
- Changes must work within the current frontend architecture without requiring major refactoring

## Risks *(optional)*

- **Risk**: Increasing preview box size may make the page feel cramped or require users to scroll more to access placeholder input fields
  - **Mitigation**: Use responsive layout that balances preview size with input form visibility; consider collapsible sections or tabs if needed

- **Risk**: Allowing free-form editing of template content might lead users to accidentally break placeholder syntax or remove important content
  - **Mitigation**: Clearly document that edits override the original template; consider adding a warning or confirmation before allowing edits; provide easy reset/revert functionality

- **Risk**: Users may not understand why the "Send to Devin" button is disabled, leading to frustration
  - **Mitigation**: Provide very clear visual feedback (tooltip, inline message) explaining exactly which placeholders are missing; consider highlighting unfilled fields

- **Risk**: Complex validation logic for enabling/disabling the button might introduce bugs or edge cases
  - **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test placeholder fill detection; keep validation logic simple and well-documented; add comprehensive unit tests

- **Risk**: Users might expect auto-save for placeholder values or edits, leading to data loss if they navigate away
  - **Mitigation**: Consider adding browser-level warnings for unsaved changes; document expected behavior; consider low-effort browser storage for temporary state
