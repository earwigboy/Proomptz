- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality - PASS

- The specification maintains technology-agnosticism by describing what users need (better form fields, editing capability, larger preview, validation) without specifying how to implement it
- All sections focus on user value: improved input experience, prevention of errors, ability to refine content, better readability
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders (product owners, designers, business users)
- All mandatory sections are present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies & Constraints

### Requirement Completeness - PASS

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all aspects of the feature are clearly defined based on the user's explicit requirements
- All 17 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-017) are testable and unambiguous:
  - FR-001: "provide dedicated form fields" - testable by observing form fields for each placeholder
  - FR-004: "validate that all required placeholders have values" - testable by checking button state
  - FR-006: "provide an editable text area" - testable by accessing and modifying content
  - FR-010: "display in a larger preview box" - testable by measuring preview dimensions
- Success criteria are measurable:
  - SC-002: "90% of users successfully fill all placeholders on first attempt" - quantitative metric
  - SC-003: "within 1 second" - time-based metric
  - SC-004: "at least 50% more visible lines" - percentage increase metric
  - SC-005: "100% prevention" - absolute metric
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
  - Focus on user outcomes (fill success rate, response time, visibility) rather than technical implementation
  - No mention of frameworks, libraries, or technical architecture
- All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios (5 scenarios each)
- Edge cases identified covering: templates without placeholders, dynamic content changes, empty content, long templates, navigation warnings, formatting preservation
- Scope clearly separates in-scope enhancements from out-of-scope advanced features
- 10 assumptions documented, 4 dependencies listed, 6 constraints defined

### Feature Readiness - PASS

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories:
  - FR-001-FR-005 (form fields, labels, validation) → User Story 1 scenarios
  - FR-012-FR-015 (button state management) → User Story 2 scenarios
  - FR-006-FR-009 (content editing) → User Story 3 scenarios
  - FR-010-FR-011 (larger preview) → User Story 4 scenarios
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable:
  - P1: Enhanced form fields + validation-based button (core functionality)
  - P2: Template editing (value-add feature)
  - P3: Larger preview (UX polish)
- Success criteria are measurable and align with user story value:
  - SC-002: 90% fill success → validates enhanced form fields (US1)
  - SC-005: 100% prevention → validates button validation (US2)
  - SC-008: 30% usage rate → validates editing feature value (US3)
  - SC-009: 40% difficulty reduction → validates larger preview (US4)
- No implementation details leak:
  - References to "form fields", "editor", "preview box" are user-facing concepts, not technical implementations
  - No mention of React, Vue, specific UI libraries, state management patterns, etc.

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan`. All checklist items pass validation. The feature is well-scoped with clear priorities, measurable success criteria, and comprehensive coverage of functional requirements. The four user stories provide independent, testable slices of functionality that can be implemented and validated separately.
