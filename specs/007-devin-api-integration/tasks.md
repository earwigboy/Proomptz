# Tasks: Devin API Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-devin-api-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Branch**: `007-devin-api-integration`

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL for this feature and are NOT included (not explicitly requested in spec).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Backend follows layered architecture: Api ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Core ‚Üê Infrastructure

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 ‚Üí User Story 2 ‚Üí User Story 3 (in priority order)
  - US2 and US3 could run in parallel after US1 if team capacity allows
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Core functionality
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 - Requires DevinClient to be functional for testing
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US1 - Requires error flows to be established

### Within Each User Story

#### User Story 1:
- Controller updates (T015-T017) must happen together (same flow)
- Frontend updates (T018-T021) can happen after controller is ready
- T018, T019, T020, T021 are all in same file, so sequential

#### User Story 2:
- T022, T023 are in DevinClient/Options (can be parallel but related)
- T024 documentation can happen anytime
- T025, T026 Docker changes are sequential
- T027 verification happens last

#### User Story 3:
- T028-T035 error mappings in DevinClient (all parallel - different error codes)
- T036, T037 frontend updates must follow backend error handling
- T038 logging updates can happen anytime

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: All 8 tasks (T001-T008) can run in parallel - different files
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T009-T012 are in same file (sequential), T013-T014 are in same file (sequential), but the two groups could be parallel
- **User Story 2**: T022-T027 has tasks marked [P] that can run in parallel
- **User Story 3**: T028-T035 all error mappings can run in parallel (different error codes), T036-T038 sequential
- **Phase 6 Polish**: T039-T046 all marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# All Setup tasks can launch together (different files):
Task T001: "Create DevinApiOptions in ...DevinApiOptions.cs"
Task T002: "Create DevinApiModels in ...DevinApiModels.cs"
Task T003: "Create DevinApiException in ...DevinApiException.cs"
Task T004: "Create DevinSessionResponse in ...DevinSessionResponse.cs"
Task T005: "Create DevinErrorResponse in ...DevinErrorResponse.cs"
Task T006: "Update SendPromptResponse in ...SendPromptResponse.cs"
Task T007: "Update appsettings.json"
Task T008: "Update appsettings.Development.json"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 Error Mappings

```bash
# All error mappings can launch together (different error codes):
Task T028: "Error mapping for 400 Bad Request"
Task T029: "Error mapping for 401 Unauthorized"
Task T030: "Error mapping for 403 Forbidden"
Task T031: "Error mapping for 404 Not Found"
Task T032: "Error mapping for 429 Rate Limit"
Task T033: "Error mapping for 500-504 Server Errors"
Task T034: "Error mapping for timeout"
Task T035: "Error mapping for network errors"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (8 tasks, ~30-45 min)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks, ~1-2 hours)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (7 tasks, ~1-2 hours)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test end-to-end with real Devin API
5. If working, this is MVP - users can send templates and get links!

**Estimated MVP Time**: 3-5 hours total

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready** (14 tasks)
2. **Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy** (MVP! Users can send to Devin)
3. **Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy** (Better configuration experience)
4. **Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy** (Better error handling)
5. **Polish ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Production ready**

### Single Developer Sequential Strategy

**Day 1**: Setup + Foundational + US1 (MVP)
**Day 2**: US2 + US3 (Error handling and configuration)
**Day 3**: Polish + Testing + Documentation

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 8 tasks (all parallel)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1 - MVP)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: 11 tasks
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 10 tasks

**Total**: 48 tasks

**Parallel opportunities**: 24 tasks marked [P] (50% parallelizable)

---

## Notes

- All [P] tasks can run in parallel within their phase
- Each user story is independently testable after completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- API key never appears in logs or client-side code (security requirement)
- Error messages are user-friendly, not technical (UX requirement)
- External API timeout set to 30s (performance requirement)
- No database changes required (pure addition feature)
- No breaking changes to existing API (backward compatible)

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. ‚úÖ **DevinClient implementation** (Phase 2) must be solid - all stories depend on it
2. ‚úÖ **Error handling** (US3) makes or breaks user experience
3. ‚úÖ **Security** (US2) - API key must never leak to frontend or logs
4. ‚úÖ **Testing** - Validate with real Devin API, not just mocks
5. ‚úÖ **User Story 1** is the MVP - prioritize completing it first

---

## Risk Mitigation

- **Unknown Devin API behavior**: Documented in research.md Open Questions - will adjust during implementation
- **API rate limits**: US3 handles 429 errors gracefully
- **Network timeouts**: 30s timeout prevents hanging requests
- **Missing API key**: Clear error messages guide user to configuration
- **Security exposure**: API key server-side only, masked in logs, environment variable injection

---

**Ready for Implementation**: Run `/speckit.implement` to execute tasks
