# Feature Specification: Devin API Integration

**Feature Branch**: `007-devin-api-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement the API connectivity to the Devin API when the user clicks on the "Send to Devin" button. The process should be to create a new Devin session (see https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/sessions/create-a-new-devin-session) and then if the request is successful display a link the user can click on to view the Devin session in their browser. There should be a way to provide a Devin API key to the application, probably in the .env file. General info on the API can be found at https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/overview, this will be useful in the research phase."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Send Template to Devin Session (Priority: P1)

A user wants to send their prompt template to Devin AI for further processing or execution. They click the "Send to Devin" button and receive a link to view the newly created Devin session in their browser.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality that delivers immediate value. Users can successfully send templates to Devin and access the session, which is the primary purpose of this integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking "Send to Devin" button with a valid API key configured and verifying a clickable session link is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has configured a valid Devin API key and is viewing a template, **When** they click the "Send to Devin" button, **Then** a new Devin session is created and a clickable link to the session is displayed
2. **Given** a Devin session was successfully created, **When** the user clicks the session link, **Then** their browser opens the Devin session page

### User Story 2 - Configure Devin API Key (Priority: P2)

A user needs to configure their Devin API key to enable the integration. The application provides a secure way to store and use this credential.

**Why this priority**: While critical for the feature to work, this is a one-time setup step that supports Story 1. Users can configure the key before using the send functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing an API key through the configuration mechanism and verifying it's properly stored and accessible to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has obtained a Devin API key, **When** they add it to the application configuration, **Then** the key is securely stored and available for API calls
2. **Given** an API key is configured, **When** the application makes API requests to Devin, **Then** the key is included in the authentication headers

---

### User Story 3 - Handle API Errors Gracefully (Priority: P3)

When the Devin API request fails, the user receives clear feedback about what went wrong so they can take corrective action.

**Why this priority**: Error handling enhances user experience but the feature can function without comprehensive error messaging in the MVP. This can be refined after core functionality is validated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various API failure scenarios (invalid key, network errors, rate limits) and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an invalid or missing API key, **When** they click "Send to Devin", **Then** they see a clear error message indicating the API key issue
2. **Given** the Devin API is unavailable or returns an error, **When** the user attempts to create a session, **Then** they see an error message explaining the failure
3. **Given** a network error occurs during the API call, **When** the request fails, **Then** the user is notified and can retry the operation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the API key is expired or revoked?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during session creation?
- What happens if the Devin API response format changes?
- How does the application behave when the API rate limit is exceeded?
- What happens if the user clicks "Send to Devin" multiple times rapidly?
- How does the system handle very large template payloads that might exceed API limits?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a configuration mechanism to accept and store a Devin API key
- **FR-002**: System MUST send an authenticated HTTP request to the Devin API to create a new session when the "Send to Devin" button is clicked
- **FR-003**: System MUST include the prompt template content in the session creation request
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a clickable link to the Devin session when the API request succeeds
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear error messages when the API request fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that an API key is configured before attempting to create a session
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle API responses asynchronously without blocking the user interface
- **FR-008**: System MUST open the Devin session link in a new browser tab when clicked
- **FR-009**: System MUST securely handle the API key and not expose it in client-side code or logs

### Key Entities

- **Devin Session**: Represents a work session in Devin AI, containing a unique identifier and URL for browser access
- **API Credential**: The Devin API key used for authentication, stored securely in application configuration
- **Template Payload**: The prompt template data sent to Devin for session creation

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully send a template to Devin and receive a session link in under 5 seconds under normal network conditions
- **SC-002**: 95% of session creation requests with valid API keys complete successfully
- **SC-003**: Users can identify and resolve API key configuration issues through clear error messages without requiring technical support
- **SC-004**: Session links successfully open the correct Devin session in the user's browser 100% of the time

## Assumptions

- Users have already obtained a Devin API key from the Devin platform
- The Devin API endpoint URLs and authentication method remain stable as documented
- Users have active internet connectivity when using the "Send to Devin" feature
- The .env file approach is acceptable for API key configuration in the deployment environment
- Browser popup blockers will not prevent the session link from opening (or users know how to allow popups)

## Dependencies

- Access to the Devin API (https://docs.devin.ai/api-reference/overview)
- Network connectivity to Devin API endpoints
- Valid Devin API key for authentication

## Constraints

- API rate limits imposed by the Devin platform may affect high-volume usage
- API key security must be maintained - keys should not be committed to version control or exposed in client-side code

## Out of Scope

- Management of multiple Devin API keys per user
- Viewing or managing existing Devin sessions within the application
- Bidirectional synchronization between the application and Devin sessions
- Webhook notifications for Devin session status changes
- Editing or updating Devin sessions after creation
