# Specification Quality Checklist: Devin API Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED âœ“

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with P1 (MVP) being the core send-to-Devin functionality
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering API integration, error handling, and security
- Measurable success criteria focusing on user experience (5-second response time, 95% success rate)
- Well-defined edge cases addressing API failures, rate limits, and security concerns
- Proper scoping with explicit out-of-scope items

**Notes**:
- The specification successfully avoids implementation details while referencing the Devin API documentation for the research phase
- Security considerations are appropriately captured in FR-009 and Constraints section
- User stories are independently testable and properly prioritized for incremental delivery
