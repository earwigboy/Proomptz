# Feature Specification: Prompt Template Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-prompt-template-manager`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that can help create,update,delete,organise prompt templates which will be given to an LLM to implement. Templates should be in markdown format, organised in a folder structure. Templates can contain placeholders for text that is entered at the point the template is used and sent to the LLM. The intended LLM target is Devin."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Template CRUD Operations (Priority: P1)

Users need to create, view, edit, and delete prompt templates that will be sent to Devin LLM. Each template is a markdown file that can include dynamic placeholders for values provided at usage time.

**Why this priority**: Core CRUD functionality is the foundation of the application. Without the ability to create and manage templates, no other features can function. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new template, editing its content, viewing the saved template, and deleting it. Delivers immediate value by enabling users to build a library of reusable prompts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no existing templates, **When** user creates a new template with title and markdown content, **Then** template is saved and appears in the template list
2. **Given** an existing template, **When** user edits the template content, **Then** changes are persisted and visible on next view
3. **Given** an existing template, **When** user views the template, **Then** all content including placeholders is displayed correctly
4. **Given** an existing template, **When** user deletes the template, **Then** template is removed from storage and no longer appears in the list
5. **Given** a template with placeholders, **When** user creates the template, **Then** placeholders are preserved in the markdown syntax

### User Story 2 - Folder Organization (Priority: P2)

Users need to organize templates into a hierarchical folder structure to manage large numbers of templates across different projects, categories, or use cases.

**Why this priority**: As users accumulate templates, organization becomes critical for findability and productivity. This builds on the core CRUD functionality to add structure and scalability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating folders, moving templates between folders, creating nested folder structures, and verifying templates are correctly associated with their parent folders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no existing folders, **When** user creates a new folder with a name, **Then** folder appears in the folder tree
2. **Given** existing folders, **When** user creates a template within a specific folder, **Then** template is associated with that folder and appears nested under it
3. **Given** an existing template in one folder, **When** user moves the template to another folder, **Then** template appears in the destination folder and is removed from the source folder
4. **Given** existing folders, **When** user creates a subfolder within a parent folder, **Then** nested folder structure is maintained
5. **Given** a folder with templates, **When** user deletes the folder, **Then** user is prompted about what to do with contained templates (delete or move)
6. **Given** multiple folders, **When** user renames a folder, **Then** folder name updates and all contained templates remain associated

### User Story 3 - Template Usage with Placeholder Substitution (Priority: P3)

Users need to use templates by filling in placeholder values and sending the resulting prompt to Devin LLM. Placeholders allow templates to be reusable across different contexts.

**Why this priority**: This represents the primary use case - actually using the templates for their intended purpose. It depends on templates existing (P1) but provides the main value proposition of the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a template with placeholders, providing values for each placeholder through a form or interface, previewing the final prompt, and sending it to Devin. Delivers value by making it easy to generate consistent, high-quality prompts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template with placeholders like `{{variable_name}}`, **When** user selects the template for use, **Then** system identifies all placeholders and presents input fields for each
2. **Given** placeholder input fields, **When** user provides values for all placeholders, **Then** system generates a preview showing the final prompt with values substituted
3. **Given** a completed prompt preview, **When** user confirms to send, **Then** final prompt is formatted and sent to Devin LLM
4. **Given** a template with no placeholders, **When** user selects the template for use, **Then** template can be sent directly without requiring input
5. **Given** placeholder values entered by user, **When** user sends the prompt, **Then** original template remains unchanged and can be reused with different values

---

### User Story 4 - Template Search and Discovery (Priority: P4)

Users need to quickly find templates among potentially hundreds of stored templates using search and filtering capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability for power users with large template libraries. Not critical for MVP but significantly improves user experience at scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by searching for templates by name, content keywords, or folder location, and verifying correct results are returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple templates exist, **When** user enters a search term, **Then** templates with matching names or content are displayed
2. **Given** search results, **When** user clears the search, **Then** full template list is restored
3. **Given** templates in multiple folders, **When** user filters by folder, **Then** only templates in the selected folder and its subfolders are shown
4. **Given** a large template library, **When** user searches, **Then** results appear within 1 second

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to delete a folder containing templates?
- How does the system handle malformed placeholder syntax in templates?
- What happens when a user tries to send a template to Devin with unfilled placeholders?
- How does the system handle templates with duplicate names in the same folder?
- What happens when a user tries to create a folder with a name that already exists?
- How does the system handle very large templates (e.g., 10,000+ lines of markdown)?
- What happens when the Devin LLM is unreachable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle special characters in folder or template names?
- What happens when a user tries to move a template to a folder that no longer exists?
- How does the system preserve markdown formatting when saving and loading templates?

### Key Entities

- **Template**: A reusable prompt with name, markdown content, optional placeholders, folder location, created/modified timestamps. Templates are the core artifact users create and manage.
- **Folder**: An organizational container with name, parent folder reference (for nesting), list of contained templates and subfolders. Folders provide hierarchical structure.
- **Placeholder**: A named variable in template content marked with `{{name}}` syntax that requires user input at usage time. Placeholders enable template reusability.
- **Prompt Instance**: A completed prompt generated from a template with all placeholder values substituted, ready to send to Devin. Represents a single usage of a template.

## Assumptions

- Devin LLM provides an interface or mechanism for receiving prompt text (integration details to be determined during planning)
- Users are familiar with basic markdown syntax for writing templates
- Template storage uses local filesystem or appropriate persistence mechanism
- Placeholder syntax `{{name}}` does not conflict with common markdown patterns users need
- Users primarily interact with the application through a visual interface (CLI, GUI, or web)
- Template content is primarily text-based; binary attachments are out of scope
- Single-user application (no concurrent multi-user editing)
- Templates are for English language prompts (internationalization not required)
