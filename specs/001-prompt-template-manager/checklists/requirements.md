# Specification Quality Checklist: Prompt Template Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and the specification is ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Analysis

- ✅ Specification contains no technology-specific references (no languages, frameworks, databases mentioned)
- ✅ Focus is entirely on user workflows (template CRUD, folder organization, placeholder substitution, search)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (business users, product managers)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities

### Requirement Completeness Analysis

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and specific
- ✅ All 24 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ All 10 success criteria include specific measurable values (time, quantity, percentage)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can create a template in under 30 seconds") rather than system internals
- ✅ Four user stories with complete Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios (26 scenarios total)
- ✅ 10 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
- ✅ Scope bounded through explicit assumptions (single-user, English language, text-based content)
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 8 key dependencies and constraints

### Feature Readiness Analysis

- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to one or more acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover the complete lifecycle: create → organize → use → discover
- ✅ Success criteria define measurable targets for performance (SC-006: 1000 templates), usability (SC-010: 90% first-attempt success), and functionality (SC-007: 100% markdown preservation)
- ✅ No leaked implementation details (no mention of specific storage mechanisms, UI frameworks, or API designs)

## Notes

Specification is production-ready and suitable for proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan` (next recommended step).

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4) enables MVP planning
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage anticipates real-world scenarios
3. Measurable success criteria provide clear acceptance gates
4. Technology-agnostic requirements allow maximum flexibility during planning

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications needed
- Consider User Story 1 (P1) as MVP scope for initial implementation
- User Stories 2-3 (P2-P3) provide clear incremental value add-ons
