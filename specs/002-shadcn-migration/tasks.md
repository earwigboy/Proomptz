# Tasks: Migrate Frontend to shadcn/ui Components

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-shadcn-migration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE per specification. Manual testing via user story acceptance scenarios will validate functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1‚ÜíP2‚ÜíP3‚ÜíP4) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app structure**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/` (backend unchanged)
- All paths relative to repository root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Install and configure shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS and required dependencies

- [x] T001 Run `npx shadcn@latest init` in frontend/ directory with configuration: Style=Default, BaseColor=Slate, CSSVariables=Yes, Tailwind=Yes, ImportAlias=@/components, RSC=No
- [x] T002 [P] Install lucide-react icons library: `npm install lucide-react`
- [x] T003 [P] Install additional dependencies: `npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge`
- [x] T004 [P] Install Tailwind dev dependencies: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer tailwindcss-animate`
- [x] T005 Add TypeScript path alias configuration in frontend/tsconfig.app.json: Add baseUrl and paths for @/* ‚Üí ./src/*
- [x] T006 Add Vite path alias resolution in frontend/vite.config.ts: Import path and add resolve.alias for @/ ‚Üí path.resolve(__dirname, './src')
- [x] T007 Configure dark theme as default in frontend/src/index.css: Update CSS variables for dark theme colors matching existing palette (#1a1a1a background, #646cff primary)
- [x] T008 Verify build succeeds and check bundle size: Run `npm run build && npm run check-size` in frontend/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Install all shadcn components needed across user stories

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T009 [P] Install shadcn Button component: `npx shadcn@latest add button` in frontend/
- [x] T010 [P] Install shadcn Input component: `npx shadcn@latest add input` in frontend/
- [x] T011 [P] Install shadcn Textarea component: `npx shadcn@latest add textarea` in frontend/
- [x] T012 [P] Install shadcn Select component: `npx shadcn@latest add select` in frontend/
- [x] T013 [P] Install shadcn Dialog component: `npx shadcn@latest add dialog` in frontend/
- [x] T014 [P] Install shadcn Label component: `npx shadcn@latest add label` in frontend/
- [x] T015 [P] Install shadcn Card component: `npx shadcn@latest add card` in frontend/
- [x] T016 [P] Install shadcn Badge component: `npx shadcn@latest add badge` in frontend/
- [x] T017 [P] Install shadcn AlertDialog component: `npx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog` in frontend/
- [x] T018 [P] Install shadcn Alert component: `npx shadcn@latest add alert` in frontend/
- [x] T019 [P] Install shadcn Skeleton component: `npx shadcn@latest add skeleton` in frontend/
- [x] T020 [P] Install shadcn Sonner (Toast) component: `npx shadcn@latest add sonner` in frontend/
- [x] T021 Verify all components installed correctly: Check frontend/src/components/ui/ contains all 11 components
- [x] T022 Run build and verify bundle size still acceptable: `npm run build && npm run check-size` in frontend/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Forms - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Cards - No dependencies on other stories, can run parallel to US1
  - User Story 3 (P3): Navigation - No dependencies on other stories, can run parallel to US1/US2
  - User Story 4 (P4): Feedback - Depends on US1 (needs forms), should run after US1-US3
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Forms**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No story dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Cards**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No story dependencies (independent)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Navigation**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No story dependencies (independent)
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Feedback**: Should start after US1 completes - Adds toasts to forms created in US1

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks within a story follow logical component migration order
- Components can be migrated independently (marked with [P])
- Each story ends with manual testing checkpoint
- Bundle size verification after each story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different dependencies)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All T009-T020 can run in parallel (installing different components)
- **User Story 1**: T023 (FolderDialog) and T029 (TemplateForm) can start in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 2**: T038-T044 (TemplateList migration) are mostly sequential, but T045 (CSS removal) can run parallel
- **User Story 3**: T049-T053 (SearchBar) and T054-T058 (FolderTree) and T059 (SearchResults) can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 4**: Toast additions (T068-T071) can run in parallel, code splitting (T075-T076) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch both form component migrations in parallel:
Task: "Update FolderDialog component in frontend/src/components/folders/FolderDialog.tsx" (T023-T027)
Task: "Update TemplateForm component in frontend/src/components/TemplateForm.tsx" (T029-T035)

# After both complete, test each independently, then move to US2
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch all three component migrations in parallel:
Task: "Update SearchBar component in frontend/src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx" (T049-T052)
Task: "Update FolderTree component in frontend/src/components/folders/FolderTree.tsx" (T054-T058)
Task: "Update SearchResults component in frontend/src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx" (T059)

# Test each independently after completion
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T008)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T009-T022) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T023-T037) - Forms migration
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Manually test all form functionality (create/edit templates, create/rename folders)
5. If successful: Forms now use shadcn components! Can deploy/demo this increment

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test forms ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP - forms work with shadcn!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test cards/lists ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Now cards consistent too!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test navigation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Navigation with icons!)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test feedback ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Complete migration!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational phase completes):

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T022)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 - Forms (T023-T037)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 - Cards (T038-T048)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 - Navigation (T049-T062)
3. Developer A then picks up User Story 4 - Feedback (T063-T079)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently, team merges sequentially

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- No automated tests generated (explicitly out of scope per spec)
- Manual testing via acceptance scenarios required at each checkpoint
- Commit after each task or logical component migration
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Bundle size monitored after each user story completion
- Code splitting in US4 keeps initial bundle under 200KB target
- Dark theme configuration in Setup ensures consistent theming throughout
