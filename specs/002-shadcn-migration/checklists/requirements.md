# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Frontend to shadcn/ui Components

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality - PASS
- The specification avoids implementation details in requirements (shadcn is mentioned as the solution being implemented, which is appropriate since that IS the feature)
- User stories focus on the value delivered (consistency, maintainability, accessibility)
- Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes and business benefits
- All mandatory sections are present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist - all decisions are clear:
  - Using shadcn/ui as the component library (stated in feature description)
  - Maintaining existing functionality (no redesign)
  - Preserving dark theme
  - Incremental migration approach
- All 20 functional requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria include both qualitative (consistency, accessibility) and quantitative measures (code reduction, no regressions)
- Success criteria are appropriately technology-agnostic where possible (e.g., "Visual consistency improves" rather than "CSS-in-JS is implemented")
- 4 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (5 scenarios for US1, 4 for US2-4)
- Edge cases cover technical concerns (prop mismatches, CSS conflicts, drag-drop, accessibility, sizing)
- Scope boundaries clearly separate in-scope migration work from out-of-scope feature additions
- 10 assumptions documented (React compatibility, Tailwind/CSS variables, incremental migration)
- Dependencies and constraints documented (bundle size, backward compatibility, existing integrations)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each of the 20 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable as required by the template
- Success criteria are measurable:
  - SC-001: Functional testing (no regressions)
  - SC-002: Visual consistency (single design system)
  - SC-003: Accessibility metrics
  - SC-004: Development velocity (standardized components)
  - SC-005: Code reduction (CSS file removal/reduction)
  - SC-006: Consistency of feedback patterns
  - SC-007: Theme functionality preservation
- No leaked implementation details - the spec appropriately describes WHAT needs to be migrated and WHY, while leaving HOW to the planning phase

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`. All checklist items pass validation. The feature is well-scoped as a component migration project with clear success criteria and independently testable user stories.
