# Proomptz Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established best practices:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, or module has one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Code duplication minimized through abstraction and reuse
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables, functions, and types use descriptive, unambiguous names
- **Type Safety**: Leverage type systems to prevent runtime errors (typed parameters, return
  values, and data structures)
- **Error Handling**: All error paths explicitly handled; no silent failures
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed by at least one other developer before merge
- **Linting & Formatting**: Automated tools configured and enforced in CI/CD

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, accelerates onboarding, and decreases
long-term maintenance costs. The cost of fixing defects grows exponentially over time;
prevention through quality standards is orders of magnitude cheaper.

### II. Testing Standards

Testing MUST ensure correctness, prevent regressions, and document expected behavior:

- **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests than integration tests; more integration tests than
  end-to-end tests
- **Independent Tests**: Each test runs in isolation; no shared state between tests
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit test suite completes in under 5 seconds; integration tests under
  30 seconds
- **Readable Tests**: Tests document behavior through clear Given/When/Then or
  Arrange/Act/Assert structure
- **Coverage Gates**: Minimum 80% line coverage for new code; 100% for critical paths
  (authentication, authorization, payment, data integrity)
- **Contract Testing**: API contracts validated through explicit contract tests before
  integration tests
- **TDD Encouraged**: For complex business logic and critical paths, write tests before
  implementation

**Rationale**: Tests are executable documentation that prevent regressions and enable
confident refactoring. Fast tests enable rapid iteration; slow tests discourage running them.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User-facing features MUST provide predictable, accessible, and delightful experiences:

- **Design System**: All UI components follow established design tokens (colors, typography,
  spacing, icons)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum; keyboard navigation and screen reader
  support required
- **Responsive Design**: Interfaces adapt gracefully to viewport sizes from 320px to 4K
- **Error Messages**: User-facing errors provide clear explanation and actionable next steps;
  no technical jargon or stack traces
- **Loading States**: All async operations provide visual feedback within 100ms; operations
  exceeding 1 second show progress indicators
- **Consistent Patterns**: Common interactions (forms, navigation, modals, notifications)
  behave identically across features
- **Internationalization**: All user-facing strings externalized for translation; date, time,
  and number formatting locale-aware

**Rationale**: Consistency reduces cognitive load and training time. Accessible interfaces
expand market reach and meet legal requirements. Predictable experiences build user trust
and reduce support costs.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Systems MUST meet defined performance budgets to ensure acceptable user experience:

- **Response Time**: API endpoints respond in under 200ms at p95 for cached data; under 1s
  for uncached
- **Page Load**: First Contentful Paint under 1.5s on 4G; Largest Contentful Paint under 2.5s
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript bundles under 200KB gzipped for initial load; code-split lazy
  routes
- **Database Queries**: N+1 queries prohibited; all lists paginated; indexes on foreign keys
  and frequently queried fields
- **Memory Footprint**: Server processes under 512MB RSS per instance; no memory leaks
  (stable over 24-hour observation)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling supported; no single points of failure; graceful
  degradation under load
- **Monitoring**: All critical paths instrumented with metrics (latency, error rate,
  throughput); alerts on SLO violations

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and
operational costs. Every 100ms delay correlates with measurable business impact. Setting
budgets prevents gradual degradation.

## Development Workflow

### Code Integration

1. **Feature Branches**: All work on short-lived feature branches from main
2. **Pull Requests**: Required for all changes; no direct commits to main
3. **CI Validation**: All tests, linting, type checking must pass before merge
4. **Review Approval**: Minimum one approving review from code owner or maintainer
5. **Merge Strategy**: Squash commits on merge to maintain clean history

### Documentation Requirements

- **API Changes**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs updated before implementation
- **Architecture Decisions**: Significant design choices documented in ADRs (Architecture
  Decision Records)
- **README Updates**: Public API changes reflected in relevant README files
- **Changelog**: User-facing changes logged with semantic versioning

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Gates

All pull requests MUST pass:

1. **Automated Tests**: 100% test suite passing
2. **Code Coverage**: New code meets minimum coverage thresholds
3. **Linting**: Zero linter errors or warnings
4. **Type Checking**: Zero type errors
5. **Security Scan**: No high/critical vulnerabilities in dependencies
6. **Performance Budget**: Bundle size and performance metrics within limits

### Pre-Release Gates

All releases MUST pass:

1. **Integration Tests**: Full integration test suite passing
2. **Manual QA**: Critical user paths validated by human QA
3. **Accessibility Audit**: No WCAG violations on new/changed interfaces
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing confirms capacity under expected traffic
5. **Security Review**: Security team sign-off for changes affecting authentication,
   authorization, or data handling

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Document proposed change with rationale and impact analysis
2. **Review**: Engineering team reviews at weekly architecture meeting
3. **Approval**: Requires 2/3 majority of senior engineers
4. **Migration Plan**: For breaking changes, define backward compatibility or migration path
5. **Documentation**: Update constitution, increment version, notify team

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New principles added or existing principles materially expanded
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes

### Compliance Review

- **Pull Requests**: Code reviewers verify adherence to principles
- **Quarterly Audits**: Engineering leadership samples PRs for compliance
- **Complexity Justification**: Violations documented in `plan.md` Complexity Tracking table
  with justification
- **Continuous Improvement**: Recurring violations trigger principle review or tooling
  investment

### Enforcement

Constitution violations are categorized by severity:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates non-negotiable principle (e.g., skipping tests for critical paths,
  security vulnerabilities)
- **HIGH**: Violates principle without documented justification in Complexity Tracking
- **MEDIUM**: Partial compliance with documented workaround or tech debt ticket
- **LOW**: Principle deviation with explicit approval and migration plan

CRITICAL violations block merge. HIGH violations require explicit maintainer override with
documented rationale.
